# Patch index

Every downstream optimization should be one identifiable commit, so that the branch history reads as
`upstream llama.cpp + patch 1 + patch 2 + ...` and any single patch can be measured, generalized,
upstreamed, or deleted on its own.

Base: `df03399b8` (`opencl: add A8 Q4_0 mm binary kernel support (#28268)` — the upstream revision
that `master` and `multigpu` diverge from). Delta: **47 commits, 39 files, +4707/−441** before the
CI/documentation commits added on top (`multigpu` = `ngram-groups` @ `e4054f726`, the configuration that
runs in production on machine-01 since 2026-10-05). Patches 1–12 are the decode-pipeline seed; 13–30 add
the continuous per-sequence decode groups and prefill-while-decoding; 31–41 the asynchronous prompt-cache
transfers, drain-free checkpoints and output-slot fixes; 42–47 the n-gram lookup speculation that works
with the groups.

**Architecture coverage is build configuration, not validation.** Release archives are compiled for
several CUDA architectures (see [builds.md](builds.md)); the patches were developed and are runtime-
validated on `sm_86` (RTX 3090) only. A patch that compiles for `sm_70` or `sm_120a` has not thereby been
shown to help, or to be correct, there.

## Runtime switches, with defaults read from the code

The whole patchset is selected at runtime, which means **one build carries all of it** — there are no
per-feature binaries and no custom CMake options. Defaults below were taken from the source, not
assumed.

| variable / flag | default | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LLAMA_DECODE_PIPELINE` | `0` (off) | off: upstream-like batch handling. `1`: pure multi-sequence decode batches are split into per-sequence ubatches and run through the stream-agnostic decode graph (patches 9, 10) |
| `LLAMA_PIPELINE_PARALLEL` | unset (upstream heuristic) | `1`: keep scheduler pipeline parallelism even when tensor overrides move input-stage tensors to CPU; `0`: force it off |
| `LLAMA_QSA_BIAS_DEVICE` | on | `0` restores the host-side QSA block bias (patch 8) |
| `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DEVICE` | on | `0` restores the host-built causal KQ mask; 2-D M-RoPE image ubatches always keep the host mask (patch 7) |
| `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_INPUTS` | on (parallel scheduler) | `0` disables rotating pinned-buffer staging of user inputs (patch 12) |
| `GGML_SCHED_N_COPIES` | `GGML_SCHED_MAX_COPIES` = 4 | lowers pipeline depth and per-input compute-buffer memory (patch 6) |
| `GGML_CUDA_GRAPHS_FORCE` | off | forces CUDA graph capture/instantiate on otherwise-unsuitable calls (patch 5) |
| `GGML_CUDA_SEGMENTED_SORT` | off | `1` restores the previous argsort behaviour; default is the asynchronous segmented sort (patch 5) |
| `LLAMA_RESERVE_ON_DEMAND_DISABLE` | inherits the base default | `1` disables on-demand reserve (patch 5) |
| `LLAMA_GRAPH_REUSE_DISABLE` | upstream behaviour | existing llama.cpp switch, overridden by the patched context init when set (patch 5) |
| `LLAMA_UBATCH_TRACE` | off | set to any value to enable per-ubatch reuse/reserve/timing and host-wait traces (patch 11) |
| `GGML_SCHED_LOG_REALLOC` | off | set to any value to log every scheduler reallocation, each of which synchronizes all backends (patch 11) |
| `--prefill-max-partial N` | `1` | max slots prefilling within one batch; `1` = first slot takes the whole batch, others wait (patch 4) |
| `--prefill-long-threshold N` | `8192` | a prompt with more than N tokens left to prefill counts as "long" (patch 4) |
| `--prefill-max-long N` | `1` | max long prompts prefilling concurrently; the rest wait in arrival order (patch 4) |
| `--seq-compact` / `--no-seq-compact` | enabled | keep busy slots on contiguous sequence ids so they decode in one ubatch (patch 3) |
| `--cache-idle-slots` | enabled | save and clear idle slots when a new task starts (patch 3 area) |
| `LLAMA_ARG_PREFILL_MAX_PARTIAL` / `_LONG_THRESHOLD` / `_MAX_LONG`, `LLAMA_ARG_SEQ_COMPACT`, `LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_IDLE_SLOTS` | — | environment forms of the flags above |
| `LLAMA_SERVER_GROUPS` | `1` (off) | N ≥ 2: slots are split into N pipelined decode groups; each group's batch is issued and parked while the others' are in flight, so decoders of different slots overlap across the GPUs (patches 19–27). Needs `-np ≥ 2` and no draft-model context; sets `LLAMA_DECODE_PIPELINE=2`. Production: 5 |
| `LLAMA_DECODE_PIPELINE=2` | set by groups | single-sequence decode batches also take the stream-agnostic graph class (one graph shared by all groups; patch 21) |
| `LLAMA_SERVER_PREFILL_CHUNK` | `256` (`0` = off) | prompt tokens per round while other slots decode; the decoders' latency is bounded by one chunk per card (patches 28–36) |
| `LLAMA_SERVER_PREFILL_MAX_WITH_DECODE` | `1` | slots allowed to prefill while others decode |
| `LLAMA_SERVER_PREFILL_EAGER` | off | issue prefill chunks eagerly (more prefill throughput, ~2× the decoders' gaps) |
| `GGML_SCHED_REPLAN_SYNC` | off | `1` restores the full drain when the scheduler re-plans a graph layout (patch 30) |
| `GGML_SCHED_NO_HOP_WAIT` / `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_WAIT` | off | bisection knobs for the cross-backend hop-copy ordering fix (patches 15, 14) |
| `LLAMA_SERVER_CKPT_SYNC` | off | `1` = synchronous context checkpoints (drains the pipeline for every user at each prompt end; patch 38) |
| `LLAMA_SERVER_XFER_STAGE_MB` | `64` (`0` = off) | pinned staging buffer per slot for prompt-cache save/restore transfers (patch 38) |
| `LLAMA_STATE_XFER_THREADS` | `4` (1..8) | copy threads for state transfers; 2.4 GiB restore 1.8 → 1.0 s (patch 42) |
| `LLAMA_SERVER_TIMINGS` | off | `1`: per-phase `update_slots` timing report every 5 s (patch 18) |
| `LLAMA_ATTN_ROT_DISABLE` | off | the production configuration sets `1` together with a quantized (`q8_0`) KV cache (patch 1–2 area) |
| `--spec-type ngram-map-k4v` (+ `--spec-ngram-map-k4v-size-m 48`) | off | n-gram lookup speculation: no draft model; the 48 tokens that followed an earlier occurrence of the last 12 tokens are proposed and verified in one batch; output identical to greedy. Checkpoints are recurrent-state snapshots in the memory (patch 44); `LLAMA_SERVER_SPEC_CKPT_SYNC=1` = old host copies |
| `LLAMA_SERVER_SPEC_MAX_USERS` | `0` (no cap) | draft only while ≤ N slots generate — every draft round re-plans the shared graph twice (~60 ms felt by every user); production: 2 (patch 46) |
| `LLAMA_SERVER_SPEC_MIN_ACCEPT` | `2.5` | acceptance gate: keep drafting while the EMA of accepted draft tokens per round ≥ this × generating users (patch 47) |

## Comparing a patch against upstream

Because each patch has a switch (or is a self-contained commit), an A/B measurement does not need two
builds:

```sh
# patched default (production shape: decode groups, prefill while decoding, async prompt cache)
LLAMA_DECODE_PIPELINE=1 LLAMA_SERVER_GROUPS=5 LLAMA_PIPELINE_PARALLEL=1 GGML_CUDA_GRAPHS_FORCE=1 llama-server ...

# closest upstream-equivalent behaviour for the decode path
LLAMA_DECODE_PIPELINE=0 LLAMA_QSA_BIAS_DEVICE=0 LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DEVICE=0 \
GGML_SCHED_STAGE_INPUTS=0 --no-seq-compact llama-server ...
```

Record which switches were flipped, the upstream commit and the multigpu commit with every number.
Env-only comparisons are cheaper than building twice, but they are **not** equivalent to upstream:
patches 1 and 2 have no opt-out, so the honest upstream comparison is always against a real upstream
build of the named commit.

## Obtaining individual patches

```sh
scripts/multigpu/export-patches.sh                 # git format-patch for the whole downstream range
scripts/multigpu/export-patches.sh -n 3            # only the last three patches
```

CI also publishes the range as a `patches-*.tar.gz` artifact on every build, so users can choose
between upstream, upstream + selected patches, or a complete `llama.cpp-multigpu` build. Explicit
`.patch` files are not committed: they would duplicate the history and go stale on the next rebase.

## Removal criteria

A patch is a candidate for deletion when upstream llama.cpp provides equivalent or better behaviour
for the target workload. The procedure per candidate:

1. identify the upstream commit that plausibly supersedes it;
2. re-sync `multigpu` onto a `master` that contains it;
3. benchmark the affected workloads (prefill and generation, 1 slot and 5 slots) at 5k/50k/150k/200k/250k;
4. if the patch no longer measurably helps, revert/drop it and note the drop here with the commit and
   the benchmark run that justified it;
5. if it still helps, keep it and record *why* the upstream version is insufficient, ideally in the
   linked upstream thread.

Dropping a patch is progress, not regression.

## Scope guard

This table is the project. A new commit here should answer: which workload on which hardware got
faster, and what number proves it? Unrelated llama.cpp features belong upstream. See
[../../README.md](../../README.md) non-goals.
